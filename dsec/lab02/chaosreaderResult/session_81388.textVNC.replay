# This is an VNC text replay program. It will replay keystrokes from
# a VNC session using the timestamps from the packet log.
#
# USAGE: run the script as normal. You can provide a factor as an
#	argument, eg "2" to run twice as fast, or "0.5" to run
#	at half time. eg,
# 		./session_0002.textVNC.replay 2
#
# Auto generated by Chaosreader.
